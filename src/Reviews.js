                <p>Put our expertise to work for you. At Alpha Consulting &amp; Tax, Inc., 
                we are proud to have received the following recognition from some of our 
                happy and loyal clients.</p>

                <p>"Fast, Easy and accurate. 2 day turnaround on my 2011 return with multiple 
                    w-2 and investment income."</p>
                <p>www.yelp.com, May 7th 2012</p>

                <p>"...knowledgeable, efficient and very patient! He's not just there to process 
                    a transaction, They consult along the way and each year we find additional ways
                    to maximize our return based on his professional advice... "</p>

                <p>"Wonderful tax accountants. I really found that I could ask the questions that other 
                    tax preparation companies would not answer. At Jackson Huit they would just tell me 
                    that I did not qualify or that the advice required more money than their basic service 
                    allowed. Mr. Shakib was very helpfull and explained it all in simple easy to understand                     
                    language. We got all of our deducations and he found others that we never knew we could                     
                    get. He costs more than the others but who cares when you saved ten times more than the 
                    other tax places.</p>

                <p>Alphatax is one of those few diamonds in the rough that I am happy to recommend"</p>
